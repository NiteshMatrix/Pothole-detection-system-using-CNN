Pothole Detection

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a robust pothole detection system utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with transfer learning.

Dataset
We have sourced the dataset from Kaggle, and you can find it here. The dataset comprises images that need to be classified into two groups:

Images with potholes
Images without potholes

Project Sections
1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
This section focuses on obtaining and preparing the dataset for training. Preprocessing steps may include resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model performance.

2. ANN-based Feature Learning
In this section, we employ Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to extract relevant features from the data. ANNs are powerful for learning complex patterns in structured data.

3. CNN-based Image Feature Extraction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilized to perform image feature extraction. CNNs are well-suited for tasks like image classification due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies.

4. InceptionV3
This section explores the implementation of transfer learning using InceptionV3, a pre-trained deep learning model. Transfer learning allows the model to leverage knowledge gained from a different but related task.

5. Model Evaluation and Optimization
The final section involves evaluating the model's performance and optimizing it for better results. This includes fine-tuning hyperparameters, adjusting the architecture, and employing techniques to avoid overfitting.
